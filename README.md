- 👋 Hey, I'm Jasper! I'm an animator who enjoys contributing to projects involved in video games!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about programming and applying it to kinematic and procedural animations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Source 2 and it's tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video games that need to clean up their animations.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord at jasper.creations#6890.
